# sec-primitives

**THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT. DO NOT USE IT**

This crate contains crypto primitives, which are part of laboratory work on the subject of "Software and data security systems".

Right now it contains:
- [x] Primes generation
- [x] RSA {en|de}cryption with OAEP-SHA256 padding
- [x] ECDSA signing/verification
- [ ] Hybrid encryption

## Tests

There is some number of tests for each primitive. I think it would be expanded in the future, but by know try:

```bash
$ cargo test
```
